## List of changes to DeCiv Redux's base 14 factions:

#### Atlas
- They are given a Mountain start bias and are now forbidden from building Enslaved units, Prison Camps and Work Camps.
- New UB: Kruger Line (standalone national wonder, unlocks at Railroads, requires Factories in every city, consumes Power, adds +2 Production to tiles with Railroads and +2 Water per Trade Route)
- TODO: Add at least one new UU and UB based off the fictional technology in the source material

#### Blackwarden
- They now start with Trade and Currency instead of Construction and Machinery.
- The Information Market adds +1 Water while the faction has Power and no longer has reduced Science gain compared to standard Libraries, but also no longer gives Great Scientist Points.

#### Children of Rust
- The Longhouse wonder is replaced with First Kiva, which retains the Longhouse's effects and also buffs the wonder by adding +40 extra City HP, +2 Faith and a bonus Pantheon belief upon founding their religion.
- TODO: Add the following UBs: Pithouse (undecided what it replaces yet, but would add +50 City HP), Kiva (replaces Shrine, added effects TBD)

#### Crimson Legion
- Their favored Religion is changed to Imperial Cult, and they are now forbidden from building Drones and Purge Robots (in accordance with the source material, where robotics are the only technology Caesar completely opposes).
- Studies no longer have reduced Science gain compared to standard Libraries, but also no longer give Great Scientist Points.
- Military Schools now add +1 Production instead of coming with a -1 Food penalty.
- New UUs:
  - Exploratores (replaces Scout, stronger, starts with Sentry, but has higher production cost)
  - Speculatores (replaces Forward Observer, starts with both tiers of Urban Warfare, double strength when attacking cities, can enter foreign borders without Open Borders treaties, but has higher production cost)
  - Legate (replaces Great General, loses instant Golden Age, builds Outposts + can go on trade missions)
- New UBs:
  - Tribal Unification Initiative (replaces Raider Suppression Initiative, no free Weapons but gives faster Great Generals, added Barbarian recruitment and improved unit training speed)

  - Caesareum (replaces Monastery, adds minor Production bonuses)
- TODO: Add a Distillery replacement that does not provide the Alcohol luxury (drugs/alcohol should be banned in Legion territory in accordance with the source material)

#### Cult of Ignis
- Armor units gain +1 Movement from their UA.
- However, the Temple is nerfed to remove both its bonus to Local Happiness and their instant Pantheon (was formerly a guaranteed Turn 1 Religion via free Great Prophet prior to them being nerfed in the base scenario).
- Fuel Depots are also nerfed: they only add +1 Culture to Oil tiles.
- Sanctums are buffed: they add +1 Faith while the faction has Power and don't have as much of a reduction in Science gain compared to standard Libraries.
- Initiate Schools are nerfed: they lose the added Science yields to Rubble/Ruins and the extra starting XP to new units is only granted to Armor units. However, they add +1 Culture/Faith while the faction has Power.

### Deadrock Clan
- Clubhouses are pushed back to Civil Service where they should be, instead of being available at Secrets of the Past. They also lose the -1 Food penalty, and the +1 Water is a base stat instead of requiring Slaves to be awarded.

- They start with fewer free techs now: knowledge of Chemistry is gained, but knowledge of Construction, Machinery and Engineering is lost. The malus on GP generation is removed, and Encrypted Data resources are doubled by their UA.
- Field Scientists are now standalone units, cost 120 Production, and have 2 charges.
- Purge Robot Proto's base Strength increased from 25 to 40, in order to give them a fighting chance.
- Standard Refineries have base yields 1 higher than the base scenario, and also gain adjacency yields (+2 Production when next to strategic resources, +2 of the respective yield when adjacent to their corresponding GI).
- Crystal Refineries gain +1 Water to their base yields and another +1 Water for adjacent Refineries, and +2 Production if built atop a strategic resource, or +4 if that resource is Oil.
- The Heat Plant building is no longer one of their unique components and can be built by everyone.
- Pre-Med Labs have been buffed to carry over the same amount of Food on population increase as the Hospitals they replace.
- Experiment on Survivors now awards a Field Scientist instead of a Great Scientist, gives +2 pop in the capital instead of +1 in all cities, and can only be built in the capital.
- Record Grids have been buffed to give +1 Local Happiness while the faction has Power and remove both the increase to Production cost and reduced Science per pop compared to the Library it replaces.
- Stormfront Center and Overcouncil now cost 150 Production each.
- New UBs:
  - Hexlock Chemical Company (replaces Food Processing Plant, adds Production/Gold yields to Refinery improvements instead of boosting Food and grants the unique Self-Repair promotion to Purge Robots instead of granting Resupply to Personnel units)
  - Advanced Chemical Refinery (standalone, requires Supremacy, doubles Refinery yields for that city and gives Purge Robots access to Chemical Weapons, but costs Coal and Power to build)
- TODO: Port over the entire gimmick rework from a certain other rebalance mod once it's finished, and until the base scenario itself reworks the gimmick

- New UBs:
  - Soup Kitchen (replaces Prison Camp, +2 Food, +1 Local Happiness, removes extra unhappiness from annexed cities, does not provide Slaves, can be built in the same city as Emergency Response Network)
  - Triage (replaces Work Camp, +10 unit healing for units adjacent to the city, +15% Production towards "support" units, +1 Local Happiness restored at Voting Rights, does not consume Slaves)

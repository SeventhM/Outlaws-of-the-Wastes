# TODO

## The main list:
- Restore the traditional Science Victory.
- Overhaul the policy tree to bring down the obscene power of half of the policies (starting three, Rationalism, Constitution, Monopoly) and make the other half actually worth taking. In addition, send the nerf sharks after several units and buildings in the base scenario that are overpowered.
- Add more new factions and City-States, along with more new unique units and buildings for the existing factions (making sure all existing factions get at least 2-3 new unique components), and adjust the unique abilities of some of the existing factions.
- And, of course, the bane of all ambitious modders who have no artistic talent: adding sprites for everything.

## Other things to consider
- Expanding the "hero unit" concept past the Hero of the Wastes found at random in survivor/barb camps. Possibly create a new World Wonder that awards a free Hero of the Wastes to the faction that builds it.
- Civ 6-style City-States giving each CS a unique bonus to its ally.

## Things I would like to be possible in the future, but will likely never happen
- Barbarian AI knowing how to utilize uniques which enable their units to freely create more encampments, amplifying the threat they pose.
- Aquatic Cities, and reworking the Mariners faction to encourage them to settle on the ocean and snag all of those resource tiles that all too often spawn too far away for anyone to work.

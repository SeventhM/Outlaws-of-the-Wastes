# TODO

## The main list:
- Add more new factions and City-States, along with more new unique units and buildings for the existing factions (making sure all existing factions get at least 2 new unique components), and adjust the unique abilities of some of the existing factions.
- Add some sort of analogue to the Archaeologist unit of BNW and a reasonable way to generate them. Their unique improvement should guarantee access to the Artifacts luxury resource.
- The bane of all ambitious modders who have no artistic talent: adding custom sprites for everything.

## Other things to consider
- Expanding the "hero unit" concept past the Hero of the Wastes found at random in survivor/barb camps. Possibly create a new World Wonder that awards a free Hero of the Wastes to the faction that builds it.
- Civ 6-style City-States giving each CS a unique bonus to its ally. This is more likely to become a separate mod, however.

## Things I would like to be possible in the future, but will likely never happen
- The ability to create resources on tiles or remove resources from tiles during a game without cheating by directly editing the save file.
- Barbarian AI knowing how to utilize uniques which enable their units to freely create more encampments, amplifying the threat they pose (but also increasing the potential rewards for dealing with the threat).
- Aquatic Cities, and reworking the Mariners faction to encourage them to settle on the ocean and snag all of those resource tiles that all too often spawn too far away for anyone to work.
- An instant Non-Standard Game Over triggered by too many nukes being launched between all factions and a way to adjust how many nukes are required to trigger it.

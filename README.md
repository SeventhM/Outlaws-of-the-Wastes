# Outlaws of the Wastes
A major expansion mod for DeCiv Redux.

## Changes applied to the base scenario

- Barbarians are stronger and spawn more frequently, but give greater rewards for clearing their encampments. (Credit for this concept goes to amfauzn and their "The Barbarians" mod.) In addition to better ruins bonuses, the survivor camp spawn rate is also increased, so players actually have a chance at finding at least one camp in most games.

- As a screw you to the AI's primitive sanity checks, the minimum allowed distance between cities has been increased.

- Deseret Nation is now a playable faction.

- Many units, buildings, wonders, promotions, and beliefs from the base scenario have been either buffed or nerfed. A file containing a full list of these adjustments will be added later.

- Several tile improvements have been adjusted:
  - Hexlock's Refineries have had their base yields increased and been given adjacency bonuses. This is to hopefully make them not as utterly useless as they currently are in the base scenario, and is done as a temporary measure until Hexlock's entire gimmick is redesigned.
  - Moisture Traps, Solar Collectors and Wind Farms receive +1 of their respective yield after researching Atmosphere Remediation, with the last one receiving another +1 on Water tiles after researching Ocean Remediation. Solar Collectors also take less time to build (10 turns on Standard).
  - Settlements no longer trigger a Culture Bomb.
  - Some of the "evil" Great Improvements have been given increased yields.
  - Terrace Farms have had their Food yields increased so they aren't instantly rendered obsolete by the adjustments to Tree Plantations.
  - Tree Plantations can now be built on Hills and Swamps after discovering Land Remediation.

## Other features

- New victory condition: Colonization (aka base Civ 5's Science Victory).

- Two new factions:
  - Camelot Foundation, a constitutional republic arising from what's left of Wales, England and Brittany.
  - The Harbingers, the remnant of an evil Mega-Corp who are now trying to atone for their previous practices...or are they?

- Six new city-states: Calico (Labor), Carbon (Farming), Defiance (Weapons), Issaquah Nation (Prayer, replacing Deseret in that slot), The Pax (Research), and Venice Beach (Trading).

- New units:
  - Barbarian: Suicider + Killdozer
  - Civilian: Great Admiral (Rekmod implementation) + Seastead Vessel
  - Military support: Wandering Doctor + Mobile Clinic
  - Scouting: Wasteland Patrol, Border Patrol, Expeditionary Force
  - Hero units (only 1 allowed per Civ): Hero of the Wastes, only available as a random camp reward

- New buildings: Coastal Defenses, Contraband Disposal Site, Earth Clinic (Naturalism only), Earthscraper (Collectivism only), Ethanol Station, Food Processing Plant, Interpretative Center, Jeweler, Tidal Array, and Workers' Facility (Collectivism only).

- New world wonder: Statue of Remembrance.

- New national wonders:
  - Homeland Defense / Wasteland Surveillance / Raider Suppression Initiatives, each locked behind a starting policy and designed to help each faction survive the early-game.
  - Oceanological Center, boosting the Science output and Happiness of coastal cities for factions that have adopted the new Rediscovery policy.
  - Resettlement Bureau, to help Collectivist factions expand faster into unclaimed territory in the mid-game.
  - Naval War College, the naval counterpart to the Military Academy, but cannot exist in the same city as the Military Academy.
  - Earthscraper Project, unlocking a powerful late-game building for Collectivist factions.

- New tile improvements:
  - Artificial atoll and Floating Settlement, unlocked at Ocean Remediation and built exclusively by the Seastead Vessel.
  - Drydock, the Great Admiral unit's Great Improvement.

- Some of the factions in the base scenario have gained one or more new unique components, and/or had their unique ability/some of their unique components adjusted. Check the Faction Adjustments.txt file for more details.

- Several new beliefs for more diverse religion customization.

- Several new ruins bonuses with each ruins effect now being weighted, along with buffs to some of the base scenario's bonuses.

- And more is planned for the future; check the ToDoList.md file for some of these things.

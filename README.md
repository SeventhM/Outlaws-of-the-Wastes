# Outlaws of the Wastes
A major expansion mod for DeCiv Redux.

## Features

- Barbarians are stronger and spawn more frequently, but give greater rewards for clearing their encampments. (Credit for this concept goes to amfauzn and their "The Barbarians" mod.) In addition to better ruins bonuses, the survivor camp spawn rate is also increased, so players actually have a chance at finding at least one camp in most games.

- Deseret Nation is now a playable faction. Five new City-States have been added.

- New faction: Camelot Foundation, a constitutional republic arising from what's left of Wales and England.

- New units:
  - Barbarian: Suicider + Killdozer
  - Civilian: Seastead Vessel
  - Military support: Wandering Doctor + Mobile Clinic
  - Scouting: Wasteland Patrol, Border Patrol, Expeditionary Force
  - Hero units (only 1 allowed per Civ): Hero of the Wastes, only available as a random camp reward

- New buildings: Coastal Defenses, Contraband Disposal Site, Ethanol Station, Food Processing Plant, Interpretative Center, Jeweler, and Tidal Array.

- New world wonder: Statue of Remembrance.

- New national wonders:
  - Homeland Defense / Wasteland Surveillance / Raider Suppression Initiatives, each locked behind a starting policy and designed to help each faction survive the early-game.
  - Naval War College, the naval counterpart to the Military Academy, but cannot exist in the same city as the Military Academy.

- New tile improvement: the Artificial atoll, unlocked at Ocean Remediation and built exclusively by the Seastead Vessel.

- Some of the factions in the base scenario have gained one or more new UUs/UBs, or had one of their UBs adjusted.

- Several new beliefs for more diverse religion customization along with buffs for a few of the weaker beliefs. However, several of the more powerful beliefs in base DeCiv Redux have been nerfed.

- Some tile improvements have been adjusted:
  - Settlements no longer trigger a Culture Bomb.
  - Tree Plantations can now be built on Hills and Swamps after discovering Land Remediation, provided they're not on Desert or Permafrost.

- And more is planned for the future; check the ToDoList.md file for some of these things.

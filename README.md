# Outlaws of the Wastes
A major expansion + rebalance mod for DeCiv Redux.

## Changes applied to the base scenario

- Barbarians are stronger and spawn more frequently, but the XP cap from combat against them has been raised, and they give greater rewards for clearing their encampments. (Credit for the "barb camps trigger ruins bonuses" concept goes to amfauzn and their "The Barbarians" mod.) In addition, the survivor camp spawn rate is also increased, so players actually have a chance at finding at least one survivor camp in most games.

- As a screw you to the AI's primitive sanity checks, the minimum allowed distance between cities has been increased.

- Pantheons require twice as much Faith to found, but do not increase in cost with each Pantheon founded; every faction present in a game can now found its own religion; and passive religion spread is 50% weaker than in the base scenario.

- Deseret Nation is now a playable faction.

- Many units, buildings, wonders, promotions, beliefs, and tile improvements from the base scenario have been either buffed or nerfed. Check the Rebalance Log.md file for a comprehensive list of adjustments.

## Other features

- Two new victory conditions, restoring the "proper" Domination and Science victories.

- Two new factions:
  - Camelot Foundation, a constitutional republic arising from what's left of Wales, England and Brittany.
  - The Harbingers, the remnant of an evil Mega-Corp who are now trying to atone for their previous practices...or are they?

- Six new city-states: Calico (Labor), Carbon (Farming), Defiance (Weapons), Issaquah Nation (Prayer, replacing Deseret in that slot), The Pax (Research), and Venice Beach (Trading).

- New units:
  - Barbarian: Suicider + Killdozer
  - City-States: State Guard
  - Civilian: Great Admiral (Rekmod implementation) + Seastead Vessel
  - Military support: Wandering Doctor + Mobile Clinic
  - Scouting: Wasteland Patrol, Border Patrol, Expeditionary Force
  - Hero units (only 1 allowed per Civ): Hero of the Wastes, only available as a random camp reward

- New buildings: Coastal Defenses, Contraband Disposal Site, Defense Directorate (City-States only), Earth Clinic (Naturalism only), Earthscraper (Collectivism only), Ethanol Station, Food Processing Plant, Interpretative Center, Jeweler, Navy Shipyard (Rediscovery only), Sanctuary, Tidal Array, and Workers' Facility (Collectivism only).

- New world wonder: Statue of Remembrance.

- New national wonders:
  - Homeland Defense / Wasteland Surveillance / Raider Suppression Initiatives, each locked behind a starting policy and designed to help each faction survive the early-game.
  - Oceanological Center, boosting the Science output and Happiness of coastal cities for factions that have adopted the new Rediscovery policy.
  - Resettlement Bureau, to help Collectivist factions expand faster into unclaimed territory in the mid-game.
  - Naval War College, the naval counterpart to the Military Academy, but cannot exist in the same city as the Military Academy.
  - Earthscraper Project, unlocking a powerful late-game building for Collectivist factions.

- New tile improvements:
  - Artificial atoll and Floating Settlement, unlocked at Ocean Remediation and built exclusively by the Seastead Vessel.
  - Drydock, the Great Admiral unit's Great Improvement.

- Several of the 14 factions in the base scenario have gained one or more new unique components, and/or had their unique ability/some of their unique components adjusted. Check the Faction Adjustments.txt file for more details.

- Several new beliefs for more diverse religion customization.

- Several new ruins bonuses with each ruins effect now being weighted, along with buffs to some of the base scenario's bonuses.

- And more is planned for the future; check the ToDoList.md file for some of these things.

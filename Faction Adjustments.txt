List of changes to DeCiv Redux's base 14 factions:

Atlas
- They are given a Mountain start bias and are now forbidden from building Enslaved units, Prison Camps and Work Camps.
- New UB: Kruger Line (standalone national wonder, unlocks at Railroads, requires Factories in every city, consumes Power, adds +2 Production to tiles with Railroads and +2 Water per Trade Route)
Children of Rust
- The Longhouse wonder is replaced with First Kiva, which retains the Longhouse's effects and also buffs the wonder by adding +40 extra City HP, +2 Faith and a bonus Pantheon belief upon founding their religion.
- TODO: Add the following UBs: Pithouse (undecided what it replaces yet, but would add +50 City HP), Kiva (replaces Shrine, added effects TBD)
Crimson Legion
- Their favored Religion is changed to Imperial Cult, and they are now forbidden from building Drones and Purge Robots (in accordance with the source material, where robotics are the only technology Caesar completely opposes).
- New UUs: Speculatores (replaces Forward Observer, can enter foreign borders without Open Borders treaties), Praetorian Guard (replaces Infantry, Strength bonus decreasing with distance from the capital), Legate (replaces Great General, loses instant Golden Age, builds Outposts + can go on trade missions)
- New UBs: Tribal Unification Initiative (replaces Raider Suppression Initiative, no free Weapons but gives faster Great Generals, added Barbarian recruitment and improved unit training speed), Victory Column (replaces Monument, +15 EXP to new units), Crucifixion Fields (standalone, built automatically in annexed cities and unsellable, kills 1 pop, generates Culture but reduces Food/Happiness, awards free Legate), Caesareum (replaces Monastery, adds minor Production bonuses)
- TODO: Add a Distillery replacement that does not provide the Alcohol luxury (drugs/alcohol should be banned in Legion territory in accordance with the source material)
Cult of Ignis
- Armor units gain +1 Movement from their UA.
- However, the Temple is nerfed to remove their guaranteed Turn 1 Religion, instead restoring the original effect of a bonus Pantheon but requiring them to found their Religion to receive it. Having a guaranteed Religion right after founding the capital is very, very OP, especially when the civ already has higher Faith yields than everyone else in the base scenario.
Hexlock
- As mentioned in the readme file, Refineries have been buffed. They have base yields 1 higher than the base scenario, and also gain adjacency yields (+2 Production when next to strategic resources, +2 of the respective yield when adjacent to their corresponding GI).
- Crystal Refineries gain +1 Water to their base yields and another +1 Water for adjacent Refineries, and +4 Production if built atop a strategic resource.
- The Heat Plant building is no longer one of their unique components and can be built by everyone.
- New UBs: Hexlock Chemical Company (replaces Food Processing Plant, adds Production/Gold yields to Refinery improvements instead of boosting Food and grants the unique Self-Repair promotion to Purge Robots instead of granting Resupply to Personnel units), Advanced Chemical Refinery (standalone, requires Supremacy, doubles Refinery yields and gives Purge Robots access to Chemical Weapons, but costs Coal and Power to build)
The Mariners
- New UUs: Drifter (replaces Worker, doesn't need to embark, can build water improvements, ~31% cheaper to build), Key to the City (replaces Anti-Aircraft Gun, doesn't need to embark, +100% Strength vs cities)
- TODO: Add a Great Admiral and Naval War College replacement
The Patriots
- New UU: The Last Minute (replaces Nuclear Missile, 15% cheaper to build; need to rename this UU later)
Proklyatyye
- Five-Year Plan and Gulag have been renamed to State Assembly and Politburo.
- New UU: Super Mutant (replaces Exo-Trooper, available earlier at Nuclear Fission but requires Atomgrad Project, consumes 2 Uranium + 1 Weapons, loses paradrop)
- New UBs: Zemlyanka (replaces Food Store, adds +50 City HP), Kolkhoz (replaces Greenhouse, higher maintenance cost, adds 2 Production along with an extra Farmer slot and 1 Production to each Farmer in the city), Corrective Colony (replaces Prison Camp, harsher Food penalties but provides 2 extra Slaves, and the penalties are negated by Politburo), Gulag (now replaces Work Camp, lower baseline Production bonuses and costs 2 Slaves instead of 1 but adds 1 Production to Food source tiles), Atomgrad Project (replaces Manhattan Project, enables Super Mutants and doubles Uranium resources)

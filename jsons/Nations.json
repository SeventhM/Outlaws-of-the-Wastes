In the earliest days after the fallout settled, I tried to mete out vengeance against those responsible for the current state of the world, unaware that I was setting myself up for my own great fall. I rallied many survivors, broken and disillusioned as I was, and set out on a brutal campaign, forgetting all I had been taught in the desire for revenge. The need to make my wrath into God's wrath. And sure enough, that disastrous journey led to my fall, and I found myself at Hell's gates.",

Changes since the Harbinger update

**Mod Options and Game Speed Adjustments**
- The survivor camp spawn rate has been drastically reduced (but is still significantly higher than base level) after determining that the previous rate was very much overpowered.
- Pantheons now cost 30 Faith to found on Standard speed and do not increase in cost as factions gain their Pantheons.
- Every player can now found a religion.
- Passive religious pressure reduced by 50%.

**Faction Adjustments**
- Atlas now has a Mountain start bias, and can no longer build Enslaved units, Prison Camps or Work Camps.
- Crimson Legion now has Imperial Cult as their favored religion, and can no longer build Purge Robot units.
- Cult of Ignis and Deseret Nation both lose their Turn 1 prophet from their unique Wonder (they can still get a free one from the Theocracy tree). Deseret now gains their free Enhancer belief upon founding their religion, while Ignis regains their free Pantheon belief but must also found their religion first.
- Cult of Ignis gains +1 Movement to Armor units.
- Deseret Nation loses the Iron Working and Steel starting techs along with the temporary Science penalty.
- The Harbingers now only get one-third as much Water and Influence from CS trade missions.
- New Star is no longer allowed to build Prison Camp or Work Camp buildings. This is temporary until I can come up with appropriate replacements for those buildings. Being a True Good faction, New Star shouldn't be allowed to have those buildings and while others may disagree with me on this stance, I consider them still being able to employ prison labor despite outlawing slavery to be an oversight.

**Promotion Adjustments**
- Forage awards 67% less Science per kill and no longer increases XP gain, but increases healing slightly in Rubble and Ruins tiles and is now available to Shooter units.
- Skirmish is no longer available to Shooter units unless they start with the promotion or upgrade from a unit that has the promotion. Not counting expansion mods, the only Shooter unit that starts with it is the Destroying Angel, and the only Shooter unit that can inherit Skirmish by upgrading from a Scout unit is the Border Patrol.
- Consequently, Precision and Suppression now list Forage instead of Skirmish as a prerequisite promotion.
- Suppression has been nerfed to a 25% combat bonus against Melee units.
- Hazard Pay no longer allows units to move immediately upon purchase, but also awards Water per kill instead of costing the unit's faction Water per kill.
- Bombardment separated into Water and Air versions, with three tiers for Bomber units, and it along with Siege are removed from Fighter units.
- Siege II and III, and Interception II and III, can no longer be awarded without first choosing the previous promotion tier.
- Targeting buffed to 33% Strength bonus vs Water units.
- Sentry removed from the promotion list for Shooter and Helicopter units, and the promotion requirements are adjusted to address an error in the promotion tree.
- Survivalism removed from the promotion list for Armor, Helicopter, and all Water and Air units.
- Evasive Maneuvers requires the second tier Fighter/Bomber promotions.
- Operational Range requires the third tier Fighter/Bomber promotions.
- Logistics no longer lists Evasive Maneuvers or Operational Range as requisite promotions, but lists Aerial Bombardment III as one.
- Air Repair can now only be accessed through Logistics.
- Chemical Weapons nerfed to lose almost half of its combat bonuses.

**Unit Adjustments**
- Nuclear weapons can no longer be purchased.
- Terraformer Part production cost is doubled.
- Ancient Armor is now a standalone UU for Almaty, and its strength has been reduced to 55. This gives players a chance to fight back in the early-game against enemy factions who are allied with Almaty or have the Army Depot in their possession.
- Ancient Armor also gains some buffs, however: base movement increased to 5 with another point added when starting its turn in friendly territory, and no combat penalty for attacking across rivers.
- Attack Boats (and the Mariners' replacement) no longer require Factories to build, so they're now properly available at Steam Power instead of being forced to wait until Manufacturing. They can now also spawn as Barbarian units.
- Border Patrol no longer starts with Skirmish.
- Expeditionary Force no longer obsoletes.
- Great Caravan's uniques were corrected so it's still properly considered a Great Merchant.
- Machine Guns are now Personnel units.
- Neutron Bomb's production cost reduced to 1000.
- Purge Robot Proto's strength increased to 40 and the Low Tech modifier is removed. This gives Hexlock a fighting chance in the early-game.
- Scouts (and New Star's First Aid units) now upgrade to Forward Observers instead of Gunmen, putting an end to a commonly abused strategy. Camelot's Wayfarers have to wait until Plastics to upgrade to Commandos instead.
- Seastead Vessels now require Oil to build.
- Speculatores regains the Forward Observer's Reconnaissance I starting promotion and also gains double combat strength when attacking cities.
- Wasteland Patrol is now locked behind Expansionism's national wonder and its production cost is increased to 60.

**Wonder Adjustments**
- Wincon wonders, International Trade Center, and Manhattan Project can no longer have their production hurried.
- Children of Rust's unique wonder, the Longhouse, has been replaced with First Kiva, which retains the Longhouse's effects but also buffs the wonder by adding 40 more city HP and a free Pantheon belief (awarded upon founding their religion).
- Salvage Tank Depot now awards an Ancient Armor instead of a Tank and its Production penalty is removed..
- Salvage Army Depot replaced with Restore Army Depot, which has 300 Production cost, awards an Ancient Armor upon completion, adds +3 Production instead of +1 to the Army Depot tile, and adds +25% Production towards Armor units in the owning city.
- Nuclear Waste Museum is now a National Wonder, addressing an issue where it could still be purchased if Excavate Nuclear Waste was built first. It also adds 10% Science and Culture to its city, adding incentive to build it.
- Distribute Soft Drinks and Fist of God have been removed from the game.
- Produce Soft Drinks buffed to add an extra point of Water and Culture to the Soft Drinks Factory.
- The Last Paradise buffed to add +2 extra Culture and Happiness to the Oasis and +10% Water to the owning city.
- Faust Project and Salvage Space Station no longer award free techs due to the bug involving World Wonders; they instead give +10% Science to the owning city and add extra yields to their respective Ancient Wonders (+2 Science for both, +1 Culture additionally for Space Station Wreckage).
- Pit of Sacrifice no longer awards a free Pantheon Belief because of that same bug; it instead kills 1 pop in the city and adds +25% Faith. This one will probably be reversed once the bug is fixed.
- Public Broadcast's production cost increased to 500 (was previously a much, much too low 100) and it now requires every non-puppeted city you control to have a Broadcast Tower, not just the city it's built in.
- Broadcast Network's production cost adjusted to 500 base + 30 per owned city, and now requires every city to have a Television Studio, instead of only needing one in the city it's built in.
- National College and Grand Monastery's base production cost reduced to 125 (were previously much, much too high, at 300/400 respectively).
- Medical Network now requires a Hospital in every city instead of a minimum of 4 cities and its base production cost is reduced to 125 (was previously 400, too high for its tech requirement) + scaling upward by 30 per owned city.
- Public Works Administration only awards one Golden Age now instead of a potential permanent Golden Age. It also loses its one measly Science point, but adds an extra Production point to all cities (that are connected to the capital). Its Production cost is reduced to 150 base + 30 per owned city.
- Heavy Equipment awards 2 free Workers and adds +3 Production to the owning city, and its Production cost is reduced to 150 base + 30 per owned city.
- Domestic Electrification's production cost reduced to 150 base + 30 per owned city (the original cost of 400 base + 50 per owned city was excessive to the point of obscenity).
- Media Center is now a normal building instead of a National Wonder.
- Fusion Reactor's cost has been reduced and its effects are drastically buffed: it now doubles the faction's Power supply and adds 25% Production to all cities.
- Homeland Defense Initiative now boosts production towards defensive buildings (Walls, etc.), reducing the time spent building them by 20%, and adds 15% more city strength from those buildings - gaining an effect that was removed from Castle Doctrine in the policy rebalance.
- Mobile Encampment adopts Rekmod Hungary's gimmick of being able to move the capital at will, once Munitions is researched.
- Naval War College now provides 4 Great Admiral points per turn.

- Listening Post (and relevant replacements) nerfed to 25% GP generation with no extra bonus for Constitution factions.
- Arcology Dome buffed to +250 City HP and +33% Water, but requires the city to be of size 20 or higher (or will once that base game bug is fixed).
- Carbon Capture no longer adds stats to Grassland tiles; it instead adds Food and Production to Tree plantations and consumes Power.
- Production building adjustments:
    - Stables (and replacements) nerfed to +1 Production per Horses tile, but the Food penalty is removed.
    - Blast Furnaces nerfed to +1 Production per Scrap/Metal tile, but the Food/Water penalties and Coal requirement are removed.
    - Aluminum Smelter no longer adds a Food/Water penalty to Aluminum tiles and restores the commented out +3 Production to the city, and also adds an Engineer slot.
    - Oil Refinery no longer adds a Food/Water penalty to Oil tiles; Ignis' Fuel Depot also removes this penalty and adds an extra Production point; both add an Engineer slot.
    - Oil Plant buffed to provide 2 Power (1 by default, 1 more if the faction hasn't run out of Oil) and remove the Food/Water penalty, and add an Engineer slot.
    - Plastics Factory buffed to add +1 Production to Plastics tiles and +2 Production to Oil tiles worked by the city.
- Water building adjustments:
    - Market (and replacements) have a Merchant slot moved to Water Storage, but gain 1 Water in compensation (Gostiny Dvor gains 2 instead).

    - Greywater Treatment Plant loses the Production penalties, but also loses its single point of Food yield and one point of base Water yield.

- Almaty CS UBs: Alma Air Base/Tank Depot now double production for their respective units.

- Camelot UBs:
    - Stone of Ages no longer awards a free Riding Arena and no longer generates Faith on its own. The player is now expected to settle at least 1-2 cities with access to Horses tiles.
    - Riding Arena adds +1 Culture to Horses.
    - The Round Table now boosts Production in all cities connected to the capital by 10% instead of adding 33% Production to the capital with Planned Economy and 5% Production towards all buildings in cities connected to the capital.
- Deseret UBs:
    - Bishop's Storehouse now adds +1 Food to Grain tiles on Desert.
    - Printing Press regains +1 Faith.
    - General Conference now counts Followers of the Majority Religion for a 15% Unhappiness reduction

**Belief Adjustments**
- The three pantheons that added Happiness to specific Natural tiles no longer do so.
- Itinerant Preachers and Religious Texts have been removed from the game.
- Atomic Children's Faith yields on Fallout/Toxic Waste reduced from 3 to 2.

- God of Commerce adds +2 Water instead of +2 Science.

**Policy Adjustments**
- The entire policy tree has been redone, borrowing mostly from Rekmod but making some deviations for the sake of lore + to keep it a bit more in line with a BNW-style expansion mod.

**Tile Improvement Adjustments**
- Artificial atolls no longer yield Happiness.
- Floating Settlements now yield Culture instead of Happiness for each adjacent Artificial atoll.
- Grasslands severely nerfed; they no longer yield Happiness and their adjacency bonuses from other natural tiles have been severely curtailed.
- Outposts and Prison farms receive extra yields (+4 Production for the former atop strategic resources, +1 Production per adjacent Farm and +1 extra Food at Land Remediation for the latter) and provide 1 extra slave each (doubled with Spoils of War now instead of Autocracy).
- Refineries have their base yields increased by 1 and gain adjacency bonuses so they're not as utterly useless as they currently are in the base scenario. This is a temporary measure until the entire gimmick for Hexlock is redesigned.
- Solar collectors and Wind farms provide 1 extra unit of Power if the player chooses Bionics as their ideology and adopts Weather Engineering, and gain +1 Production at Atmosphere Remediation (Wind farms on Ocean tiles gaining another +1 Production earlier at Ocean Remediation).
- Solar collectors also have their construction time reduced to 10 turns (on Standard speed).
- Terrace farms receive extra food scaling (they now start at 2 base and add 1 with adjacent Farm or Grassland tiles) so they aren't obsoleted by Tree plantations being buildable on Hills.

**New Victory Conditions**
- Colonization Victory has been added, inspired somewhat by the "DeCiv in Alpha Frontier" fanfic-tier expansion mod for Alpha Frontier.
- The "proper" Domination Victory condition of only needing to capture all enemy capitals is also enabled.

**New City-State**
- The Pax, Research type, inspired by the Gene Roddenberry film *Genesis II*. If they spawn in the game, kiss the Cryo Sanctum wonder goodbye since it's awarded to them for free at the start. The only CS type missing now from the mod is Culture (but at least one more each for Prayer and Labor are also needed).

**New Buildings and Wonders**

- Advanced Chemical Refinery, a standalone UB for Hexlock locked behind Supremacy that doubles Refinery yields and grants Chemical Weapons to Purge Robots
- Alma Strategic Reserve, a standalone UB for the Almaty CS giving them more Oil so they can build more of their UUs. It will be destroyed if they're captured.

- Exotic Reactor - yes, another standalone UB for the Defiance CS, giving them more Power, but like their other UBs it will be destroyed if they're captured.
- Kolkhoz, Proklyatyye's replacement for the Greenhouse, adds +2 Production, 2 Farmer slots instead of 1, and +1 Production to active Farmers in the city, but has higher maintenance

- Oceanological Center, locked behind Rediscovery, consuming Power and boosting Science/Happiness for coastal cities
- Resettlement Bureau, locked behind Collectivism, converting 1 pop in the capital to a Civilian Convoy and adding a production boost to Civilian Convoys along with Food yields to Settlements
- Sacred Cave, Deseret's replacement for the Shrine, adding +50 City HP, +1 Culture, and an additional +2 Culture/Faith to Ancient Wonders if the player is lucky enough to settle near one
- Sanctuary, a Happiness boosting building meant to encourage building Nature preserve improvements since it adds yields to those improvements (+1 Food/Water/Culture) but requires the city to be working at least 1
- Workers' Facility, locked behind Collectivism, provides a free Factory and boosts the city's Science output by 10% but consumes Power, has high maintenance, and cannot be sold

**New Units**
- Great Admirals are added in the form of their present Rekmod implementation. They use the "Is part of Great Person group" unique and do not increase the GPP cost of other Great People.
- State Guard, a unit exclusive to City-States made in response to the latest update to DeCiv Redux enabling capital razing. Tellus gets a unique version that can plant more trees. Almaty is excluded, because it gets...
- Alma State Guard, the new Spearman replacement for Almaty with the same combat strength/promotions as NBC Infantry and a combat bonus in friendly territory, so Almaty retains the ability to defend itself from aggressive AI factions in the early-game.
- Exploratores, the Legion's replacement for the Scout with increased strength, starts with Sentry, can move after attacking, and has a chance to capture any Barbarians it picks off, but has a higher production cost.
- Pridwen-class, Camelot's replacement for the Missile Cruiser with increased strength but also has a higher production cost.
- Rapid Response Squad, New Star's replacement for the Forward Observer that starts with Medic I/II and Gas Mask, has extra strength when defending, and can instantly clear Fallout, but has a higher production cost.
